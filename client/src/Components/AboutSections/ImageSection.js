        <p >
          A Full Stack Web Developer with a background in music. I am passionate
          about the ability to create and bring imaginations to
          life through visual representation, creating something unique
          that people can feel, interact and work with.
        </p>
        <p>As a musician, I was based at various locations overseas,
        working for an international non-profit organization as a music
        educator and mentor with a focus and emphasis on community development,
        humanitarian work, and project management.
        Being in a leadership role has honed leadership skills, communication
        and collaborative work which are crucial for working in teams.
        I am open-minded and focused on learning, growing and multiplying.
        </p>
        <p>I aim to leverage my prior music insights in my career-transition
        as a web developer as it has provided me with keen attention to detail,
        the ability to persevere, to refine until excellence achieved, to be
        self-disciplined, and the skill to coordinate multiple tasks at once.
        I believe in the power of technology as a modern tool for transforming
        the status quo of our current generation.
